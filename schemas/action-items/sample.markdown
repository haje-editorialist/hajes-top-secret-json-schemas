### Summary

Haje Jan Kamps and Rafael Ortiz discussed the strategic vision for content, focusing on "building trust at scale or bust," and agreed that current personalization initiatives are not ambitious enough, leading Haje Jan Kamps to demonstrate a fully AI-generated, customized newsletter prototype. Stefania Allen supported scaled personalization but questioned the use of AI sketches over customized visuals featuring actual models or street style, and inquired about the content strategy following Danielle’s shift. Rafael Ortiz and Haje Jan Kamps clarified the strategy involves running editorial content for traffic, introducing an AI SEO content vertical for profit, and focusing on platform-contributed output, emphasizing a shift away from relying solely on the editorial team to embrace these changes. Haje Jan Kamps also expressed concern about the lack of social media vision, and Rafael Ortiz set the compensation for platform contributors in the closets initiative at 25% on net.

### Details

* **Global Politics and Luxury Trends** Haje Jan Kamps and Rafael Ortiz briefly discussed global politics, with Haje Jan Kamps expressing concern about Europe's security if NATO were to fall. Stefania Allen joined, noting the intense topic, and shifted the conversation to luxury items, mentioning an exact dupe of a designer bag and the trend of lab-grown diamonds, which they would short the natural diamond industry if possible ([00:01:57](#00:01:57)).

* **Content Vision and Trust** Haje Jan Kamps introduced a vision and mission for content focused on "building trust at scale or bust," noting that trust is the core luxury piece ([00:02:59](#00:02:59)). Rafael Ortiz affirmed that trust is key and identified several paths to achieving it, including the "wire cutter" approach of earning trust through rigorous testing, leveraging celebrity influence, expert relationships (like the styling team), or cumulative brand trust ([00:04:01](#00:04:01)).

* **Ambitious Personalization Initiatives** Haje Jan Kamps expressed that the current initiatives regarding personalized user experiences (the X of one, shop of one, etc.) are not ambitious enough, advocating for fully customized and personalized experiences to truly own the luxury and trust narrative ([00:04:50](#00:04:50)). Rafael Ortiz supported this ambition ([00:06:02](#00:06:02)).

* **AI-Generated Personalized Content Prototype** Haje Jan Kamps shared a prototype of a fully AI-generated, customized newsletter based on the outfit index page, created in three hours of "vibe coding" ([00:06:02](#00:06:02)). This prototype includes AI-generated text and sketches of outfits, with alternative options and a shop button, and Haje Jan Kamps noted that generating this customized newsletter costs about 8 cents ([00:07:05](#00:07:05)).

* **Scaling Personalized Content** Haje Jan Kamps challenged the team's lack of ambition, noting that the AI-generated prototype took only three hours, suggesting that with 60 developers, they could achieve much more engaging, customized content ([00:08:14](#00:08:14)). Rafael Ortiz supported the direction toward ultra-targeted communications, stating that while the challenge lies in making it work on a unit basis, it is the right direction for the company ([00:09:15](#00:09:15)).

* **Strategy for Content Personalization** Haje Jan Kamps stressed that ultimately, segmentation needs to be focused on one person, as enough information is available to create far more ambitious content ([00:09:15](#00:09:15)). Rafael Ortiz acknowledged the conceptual alignment with super personalized content but questioned if the team could successfully execute it, suggesting that moving incrementally toward grouping content first, as Skyler and Ryan are planning, might be the preferred, though less ambitious, immediate step ([00:10:09](#00:10:09)).

* **Prioritizing Content and Cutting Ineffective Activity** Rafael Ortiz advised Haje Jan Kamps to identify and eliminate tired, ineffective, or off-brand content to create space for pushing down avenues that make more sense ([00:11:12](#00:11:12)). They suggested allocating budget for passionate projects like Haje Jan Kamps' late-night prototyping to achieve a "stepped increase" in performance ([00:12:01](#00:12:01)).

* **Personalization Execution and Visuals** Stefania Allen agreed that scaled personalization per email is the future but offered assistance with execution, specifically questioning the use of AI-generated sketches ([00:12:01](#00:12:01)). Stefania Allen suggested that customized visuals should feature the item on an actual street style person or model, perhaps incorporating a "Zara tryon model" concept where the item is shown on the user who uploaded their picture, as this would likely sell better than a sketch ([00:12:59](#00:12:59)).

* **Editorial Team Strategy and Direction** Stefania Allen expressed uncertainty about the current strategy following Danielle's shift and eventual departure, asking if the front-facing editor content play has been abandoned. They highlighted a lack of outreach from Harry and Jordan regarding talent for the expert initiative and questioned if the strategy had shifted, possibly towards more AI-generated content ([00:13:56](#00:13:56)) ([00:15:55](#00:15:55)).

* **Evolving Content Strategy: Editorial, AI SEO, and Platform** Haje Jan Kamps clarified that the current strategy involves keeping editorial content running for traffic and sales, introducing a new AI SEO content vertical for profit generation, and focusing on platform-contributed output (closets and guest articles) ([00:15:55](#00:15:55)) ([00:19:16](#00:19:16)). Rafael Ortiz summarized the strategy as social-first, super-efficient AI-assisted content, and building trust through the platform play ([00:20:15](#00:20:15)).

* **Shift in Focus from Editorial Team** Rafael Ortiz explained that the strategy hasn't changed but the method of execution has, as the company will no longer wait for the editorial team to embrace these new initiatives ([00:20:15](#00:20:15)). They suggested letting the edit team focus on producing the best editorial content possible, while the AI and expert-contributed content will be pursued without them, indicating that those who can't or won't lead the new direction will be moved beyond ([00:21:30](#00:21:30)).

* **Editorial Content and Trust** Haje Jan Kamps acknowledged that while AI-generated SEO content can be highly effective, high-quality editorial content is crucial for building and maintaining user trust ([00:23:41](#00:23:41)). They also noted that core editorial content is necessary to continue delivering page views, which Marissa relies on for selling advertising against ([00:24:31](#00:24:31)).

* **Data-Driven Content Decisions** Haje Jan Kamps reported that the editorial content is performing better, despite putting out less content, suggesting that previous SEO efforts and social lift are contributing to growth ([00:24:31](#00:24:31)). They emphasized the need to be data-driven to understand which article types drive page views versus revenue, aiming to adjust content commissioning to hit KPIs ([00:26:43](#00:26:43)).

* **Embracing Successful Content Formats** Stefania Allen and Rafael Ortiz advocated for being intellectually honest and data-driven by continuing to produce content formats that demonstrably work, such as collages, even if it dominates the feed ([00:28:52](#00:28:52)). Rafael Ortiz noted that the team should not be above copying concepts that are working for other high-engagement handles, provided they align with the brand's DNA ([00:32:12](#00:32:12)).

* **Need for Social Media Vision and Head of Content** Haje Jan Kamps expressed concern about the lack of vision and ambition regarding social media within the current team, noting that successful social ideas are currently flowing from Rafael Ortiz and Marissa's team ([00:30:30](#00:30:30)) ([00:41:22](#00:41:22)). Haje Jan Kamps concluded that the immediate order of operations should be to hire a head of content who is excited to run experiments and can drive the social strategy forward, leveraging external resources as needed ([00:43:13](#00:43:13)).

* **Compensation for Platform Contributors** The discussion turned to the compensation structure for platform contributors, particularly the closets initiative, with Haje Jan Kamps suggesting an advance payment plus a commission percentage to incentivize participation ([00:45:34](#00:45:34)). Rafael Ortiz definitively set the commission at 25% on net, eliminating negotiation and compensating for the rough product and lack of an easy platform ([00:47:03](#00:47:03)).

* **Focusing on Core Strengths and Innovation** Haje Jan Kamps reiterated a focus on what works, minimizing investment in core editorial while acknowledging its halo effect, and redirecting resources freed up by Danielle's departure toward scalable innovation like the "newsletter of one" ([00:35:36](#00:35:36)). Stefania Allen brought up the concept of "live shopping" as a potential area for quick experimentation, noting that it's a trend seen in China and discussed by Gary Vaynerchuk ([00:36:33](#00:36:33)) ([00:38:25](#00:38:25)).

* **Social Media and Organizational Structure** Haje Jan Kamps acknowledged the internal complexity of where social media belongs, noting that it was initially placed under Brian as a marketing function, but should arguably be a content function ([00:39:07](#00:39:07)) ([00:40:42](#00:40:42)). Stefania Allen agreed and suggested including Brian in future meetings to facilitate discussions on social-first ideas and testing, particularly as he is vetting social agencies ([00:50:52](#00:50:52)).

* **Using the Styling Team for Content Generation** Haje Jan Kamps confirmed they would be heavily relying on Gabby from the styling team for the next batch of 60 articles, shifting content creation away from the editorial team. Stefania Allen strongly recommended using stylists like Gabby and Mariela for AI SEO stories, as they are product experts who can deliver quality work more cost-effectively than the edit team ([00:53:15](#00:53:15)) ([00:55:31](#00:55:31)).

* **Scaling Styling for Content** Haje Jan Kamps is aiming to scale up AI SEO article generation to 100 per month by March, which will require utilizing multiple people from the styling team ([00:56:10](#00:56:10)). Haje Jan Kamps proposed developing a system like "Uber for styling," where vetted talent can pick up work for extra hours on demand ([00:56:55](#00:56:55)).

### Suggested next steps

- [ ] Stefania Allen will send the podcast about live shopping to the group.  
- [ ] Stefania Allen will close the deal with the talent for the closets initiative using a 25% commission rate on net sales.  
- [ ] Stefania Allen will mention to Gabby to contact her if Gabby has any questions regarding the content creation process.  
- [ ] Stefania Allen will keep Haje Jan Kamps posted on the styling platform implementation so she can assist.  
- [ ] Haje Jan Kamps will finish up the documentation and do the final testing with Gabby for the styling platform.  
- [ ] Stefania Allen will work with Haje Jan Kamps to test the personalized email concept and determine what the consumer would want to see.  
- [ ] Haje Jan Kamps, Rafael Ortiz, and Stefania Allen will incorporate Brian into the content strategy meeting.

### 00:00:00

   
**Haje Jan Kamps:** Hello Sanjan.  
**Rafael Ortiz:** Hello, sunshine.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** How goes  
**Rafael Ortiz:** Goes pretty well.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** it?  
**Rafael Ortiz:** Um, I'm engaging a uh real estate agent looking at property  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** To sell or buy something?  
**Rafael Ortiz:** in Greenland.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** How very expansionist of you.  
**Rafael Ortiz:** I I guess we're gonna go like I'm expecting we're going to go full Nazi in another couple months.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** Well, I don't think Greenland is the safest place to go to be  
**Rafael Ortiz:** Yeah.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** honest.  
**Rafael Ortiz:** No, I'm sure Americans are at risk there.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** I've got to say the Norwegian news media is s\*\*\*\*\*\*\*  
**Rafael Ortiz:** I I made I just made the mistake  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** bricks.  
**Rafael Ortiz:** of watching the presidential news conference and I must say I I really  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** Yeah, don't do that.  
**Rafael Ortiz:** regret it. It took all the wind out of my sails.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** Yeah. Yeah. It's really quite upsetting. Honestly, I'm um I don't know what to say.  
   
 

### 00:01:57 {#00:01:57}

   
**Haje Jan Kamps:** It's like I If NATO falls, then Europe is gone too because Russia will just walt straight into several more states. Like I am really terrified that we're at the edge of like very serious trouble right now. Hi,  
**Stefania Allen:** Hi,  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** we just we're just discussing some global  
**Stefania Allen:** I joined some sounding intense.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** politics.  
**Rafael Ortiz:** But at least we're in luxury.  
**Stefania Allen:** Oh,  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** At least we're in luxury and at least we're in California. It seems pretty far away from everything else, but who knows?  
**Stefania Allen:** well, speaking of luxury, I bought an Amazon dupe of a dopiano bag for my daughter,  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** Uhhuh.  
**Stefania Allen:** and it is exactly the same.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** Interesting.  
**Stefania Allen:** So depressing. It's so depressing.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** It is,  
**Stefania Allen:** And there's this whole conversation with natural diamonds and lab grown diamonds,  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** but also interesting.  
**Stefania Allen:** which I could talk about exhaustively. It's my it's one of my favorite topics.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** Uh-huh.  
   
 

### 00:02:59 {#00:02:59}

   
**Stefania Allen:** Um, and I would short the diamond industry if I could. Um, but that's a whole other topic.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** I mean,  
**Stefania Allen:** Speaking of luxury,  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** that seems reasonable to short some of this uh shenanigans. Um,  
**Stefania Allen:** It's all about the  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** it really is. Um,  
**Stefania Allen:** brand.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** it really is. I think that's what continues to be the luxury piece of this, right? And I think I mean I I know you had a quick skim through it, Stephie, but I came up with like a vision and mission for content which I think really underscores that. It's like it's building trust at scale or bust. Like I think your I can't remember if the tail end of last year or was earlier this year Rafie, but when you started talking about trust more that was the piece where it clicked into place for me. It's like, oh yeah, if people trust what we're doing, we have something. If they don't, it's going to get really  
   
 

### 00:04:01 {#00:04:01}

   
**Rafael Ortiz:** Yeah.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** challenging.  
**Rafael Ortiz:** And there are several ways to get to trust, right? There's not just one path. Um I tried doing the wire cutter approach where you earn trust, right? We test the daylights out of this thing so that you will believe that what we're saying is true.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** Right.  
**Rafael Ortiz:** We couldn't do it. So maybe maybe someday I'll come back to that.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** Right.  
**Rafael Ortiz:** But we couldn't do it.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** Right.  
**Rafael Ortiz:** Uh a celebrity is wearing it. If you know someone attractive who has unlimited money, looks is dressed well, they're probably styled, you believe it, right? There's trust there.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** Right.  
**Rafael Ortiz:** If you have a relationship with an expert, which is our styling team, you trust them, right? There's several ways to get there.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** Mhm.  
**Rafael Ortiz:** Or maybe the brand name, right? So, if the brand is just has acred so much uh cumulative trust, you know, you you just put it in the brand, that's that's another way, but that's that's a build.  
   
 

### 00:04:50 {#00:04:50}

   
**Haje Jan Kamps:** Right.  
**Rafael Ortiz:** It's not overnight. Lot lots of ways to get  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** Right. Yeah. I think that's exciting. I think that's an opportunity for us.  
**Rafael Ortiz:** there.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** Um I've been doing a lot of things. So sorry not to completely sidetrack this entire meeting, but I've been doing a lot of thinking about the conversations we've been having about the X of one, the shop of one, the page of one, the logged in experience of one, the uh newsletter experience of one, and how that ties in with the outfit index in particular. But also like the the various closet initiatives we have running and all this kind of stuff. and I'm looking at what we're doing and I'm feeling like it's not nearly ambitious enough and maybe I'm just getting a little ahead of myself, but I'm eager for us to really own that. Like if we're talking about luxury experience, if we're talking about trust, if we're talking about all these pieces, like I don't think it's too much to ask for to really think about what does a customized, personalized experience look like for our users.  
   
 

### 00:06:02 {#00:06:02}

   
**Rafael Ortiz:** I like the ambition.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** Let me show you something. Um, so you saw some messages from me in various channels at midnight. That was because I couldn't sleep. And I was looking at these uh outfit index pages and I was actually just being a little bit upset. I was like, it's we've put so much time and work into creating something awesome here. And this is kind of the best we can do. So, it's creating good products. Like the product selection is pretty decent. It's got good links through.  
**Stefania Allen:** Hey.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** Sorry.  
**Stefania Allen:** Oh no, I there's a lot of noise. There's the gardeners. Did I make a  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** Um but I um basically for about three hours last night  
**Stefania Allen:** noise?  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** was vibe coding and came up with this. So this is a fully AI generated version of this page except it pulls in customized text a short bump. Again, these need to be improved.  
   
 

### 00:07:05 {#00:07:05}

   
**Haje Jan Kamps:** And then make an AI generated sketch of what the outfit can look like with the bag, with the shoes, with the um with the skirt and from there a newsletter version of the same. So like, hey, what does it look like if we take an outfit index page and turn it into something that is actually fully customized? So here it pulls in the product description we have but feeds that into an AI and generates like a a piece of content that actually people can read and look at with additional options for the various things. And so it just goes down the the outfit index page and says look these are the shoes that we chose but here's some alternatives. Here's the bag we chose but here's some alternatives with some text with a shop now button. This is a fully usable, fully um newsletter of one newsletter that is dynamically generated. And there's nothing about this that is a cheated. This is like I've put this together in three hours vibe coding in the middle of the night.  
   
 

### 00:08:14 {#00:08:14}

   
**Haje Jan Kamps:** And with some of these, there's obviously a bunch of uh improvements that need to happen, but I think this is such a more engaging way of looking at this stuff. like we've got text that actually talks about the the pictures or the codes that are in the pictures. Uh it's is it I mean the image could be better, but at least now you get a sense of something that is customized, right? This person with the bright green shoes, let's pull that forward and actually show it off with the trench co trench coat, the black shoes, the green, sorry, the green shoes, the black pants, all this kind of stuff. And the reason I'm sharing all of this is that I am just like, why are we being so unambitious? This took me three hours. We have 60 developers. Like I think we can do so much better than what we're doing and make it a lot more engaging. And this like it costs u 8 cents to generate.  
   
 

### 00:09:15 {#00:09:15}

   
**Haje Jan Kamps:** So yeah, it costs money. And if we do 10,000 of them, it costs real money. But right now, we're sending out like how many emails about uh the outfit index where we could be doing so much better.  
**Rafael Ortiz:** I like the ambition. Oh, yeah. Nothing wrong with heading toward uh ultrarargeted uh comms,  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** Yeah.  
**Rafael Ortiz:** right? if it's ultraargeted and and on point, it'll it'll work right on a unit basis. So,  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** Yeah.  
**Rafael Ortiz:** the challenge is getting it uh getting it to work on on a unit basis. But, uh in general, it's it's the direction of travel for  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** I think so too.  
**Rafael Ortiz:** us.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** And I think this is where we have a real opportunity to really stand out. Like the conversations I was having with Skyler was around like how how good can we segment. I was like look ultimately the segment needs to be one person. Like yeah we can group it by type of user.  
   
 

### 00:10:09 {#00:10:09}

   
**Haje Jan Kamps:** Yeah, we can group it by whatever, but by for a lot of these users, we have enough information to be able to do something far more ambitious if we want to. And I do realize I'm kind of throwing a spanner in the works where there's a like there's a big difference between creating a prototype of something and shipping something.  
**Rafael Ortiz:** Yeah.  
**Stefania Allen:** That's  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** I completely understand that. But I'm looking at the stuff we're putting out and I'm just like, what are we doing?  
**Stefania Allen:** not  
**Rafael Ortiz:** There's nothing wrong with teeing up some experiments and see if you can uh get a working PC um that validates it. In fact, I mean maybe um so conceptually aligned with a a super personalized thing, we are far from it. Is it better for us to go incrementally and start go from kind of the mass basically mass luxury content that we've done for a while and into some level of grouping? That's where Skyler and Ryan are trying to go, right? They're like, let's just get some kind of segments going.  
   
 

### 00:11:12 {#00:11:12}

   
**Rafael Ortiz:** There's nothing wrong with that. That's probably the right thing to do. Now,  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** Yeah.  
**Rafael Ortiz:** if you want to skip all that and say, "I I can do this successfully for any number of people by giving them totally personalized content," it's super attractive. No one's going to no one's going to say, "No, that's not valuable." I think the challenge is can you can can you prove it? Are you there?  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** And again, I mean,  
**Rafael Ortiz:** But I'm all down.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** I'll be super honest. This was three hours in the middle of the night. So,  
**Rafael Ortiz:** But, you know, you might you might be on to something.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** um,  
**Rafael Ortiz:** And I guess the um the one thing that I was going to say first after looking at your deck is the main thing that strikes me is, hey, what else are we going to cut out? Let's just cut some s\*\*\*  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** Mhm.  
**Rafael Ortiz:** out that is tired, never worked, maybe not on brand.  
   
 

### 00:12:01 {#00:12:01}

   
**Rafael Ortiz:** You know,  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** Mhm.  
**Rafael Ortiz:** there are some things that just need to be called out so you or we or the team has space to push down avenues that make more sense because there's a lot of activity of what I see. Lots of activity, story types, this that most of it doesn't work,  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** Yeah.  
**Rafael Ortiz:** some does. Let's take those insights. Why does it work? How did we make that decision? What do we where do we go from there? And if you want to allocate some budget for you know uh middle of the night kind of passion things to really get uh stepped increase like you should be free to do  
**Stefania Allen:** I think where I'll weigh in is in terms of the concept.  
**Rafael Ortiz:** that.  
**Stefania Allen:** I agree. I think that that is the future in terms of if there's a scale if there's a scaled way to do personalization like that per email. I mean absolutely no denying that that would work. where I can help you is in terms of the execution so that we can kind of like play around with.  
   
 

### 00:12:59 {#00:12:59}

   
**Stefania Allen:** Okay, you saw that sketch. Was that intended to be the person that we're sending it to? Sort of like the Zara tryon model where I don't know how familiar you are with some of the things that others are doing, but like you can take a picture and it has the Zara item on you. So, I didn't know if that was the intent or if that was just you needed the sketch. So, but you should think about that. Hi, because I would rather see the image of it on an actual let's say influencer talent street style person versus a sketch of nothing. If the sketch is of something then let's have it be of that person like upload a picture and then we put the item on them and that be the personalized email of like kind of creepy but this is what it would look like on you that entire outfit. Um and and chances are you might sell it better that way versus like a  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** Mhm.  
**Stefania Allen:** sketch. So I can work with you in terms of like if you want to test it, what I think the consumer would want to see in the personalized email.  
   
 

### 00:13:56 {#00:13:56}

   
**Stefania Allen:** And then jumping ahead to Rafy's point about the deck.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** Mhm.  
**Stefania Allen:** I think we can go through the deck, but I think my biggest questions are where are we in terms of and Rafie might know the answer to this, but I basically left off in terms of Danielle coming at us with a completely different approach and now her since not parting ways,  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** Yeah.  
**Stefania Allen:** but totally shifting. And honestly, I haven't even heard from her. So, I don't know what's going on. And I haven't heard from Harry and Jordan. So, I feel lost in terms of did we sort of like abandon this front-facing editor content play or are we just not there yet because we don't have like we're still getting our ducks in a row in terms of who's doing what. Um, and then in terms of the expert initiative, so Zab and I have been working on those names that you put at the bottom. Zab and I have been working on it with the exception I think of Jessica Minkoff, but I'm still not getting any sort of like outreach from Harry and Jordan in terms of talent and I'm not sure if they don't need the support if or you know like so that was honestly my  
   
 

### 00:14:55

   
**Haje Jan Kamps:** Mhm.  
**Stefania Allen:** more my question of like I'm offering myself. I want to make sure that they feel like they have us there. So those were my big picture things because I did read the deck. Thank you for sending it.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** Yeah. Well, thank you for taking the time. I mean, just a context for that is that I uh in a previous era, we had like a a monthly meeting where we're clicking through a deck and we're spending an hour talking about numbers. And I was like, we're not doing that anymore. We're doing a pre-eread. If you read it, great. If you don't read it,  
**Stefania Allen:** No.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** that's on you. But we're just talking about what the learnings are. like all the data goes in the deck but I only there's some slides where I want to say we spend 90% of the meeting on the what did we learn what worked what didn't work which experiments do we cut what do we continue with and just really make it more action forward um so that was really I just wanted to give you that context um in terms of um getting inbound or getting inbound uh requests to you like I keep  
   
 

### 00:15:55 {#00:15:55}

   
**Stefania Allen:** And don't mean it to about me. It's not about me. It's how can I be help?  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** Bye-bye.  
**Stefania Allen:** Like I just don't know where we are at from a strategy because the strategy was so much about internal team and talent and yet I hear not as much request from the internal  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** Yeah.  
**Stefania Allen:** team and I don't see them really reaching out to external talent. So then I'm kind of like is the strategy shifted? It might have. You might have been like with Danielle leaving I'm going to do something different. It's all going to be AI. Like it's more of a question not necessarily a feedback.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** the strategy right now uh which isn't very very well um elucidated in this deck. So I'll take that as feedback is basically let's keep editorial just running like it isn't working for one set of um sets but  
**Stefania Allen:** Okay,  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** it is working in terms of we are getting traffic we are getting uh some amount of sales through and it gives Marissa something to sell where I'm curious is the two other content verticals that I'm talking  
   
 

### 00:16:51

   
**Stefania Allen:** got it.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** about AI SEO which is really SEO driven and we've now published quite a few articles and they're looking good and they're seem like they're performing and those articles are like fully AI generated. Um the cost of creating those articles is low enough that I think they will be revenue generating like profit generating sooner rather than later. So I'm excited about that. Right.  
**Stefania Allen:** Mhm.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** Um what I'm trying to scale towards actually let me just pull up this slide so we have it in front of us. um this guy. So, basically having um uh 34 stories going live in December. Um which is isn't entirely true. Some of those went live in uh November, but it's kind of been drip feeding. And I got so much push back from the content team about this wasn't good enough, that wasn't good enough. Eventually, it was so watered down that there was kind of nothing left. A lot of those articles that went out, they did really well in newsletter, but when you look at them as a human being, I'm like, oof, this just isn't really where we're at.  
   
 

### 00:18:04

   
**Haje Jan Kamps:** And Vila actually helped me to task. He's like, what are we doing here? Like, this isn't good for SEO. This isn't good for users. Like, I don't know why we're doing this. And took a step back and I was like, actually, you're right. You're totally right. This isn't good enough. Like, our bar should be much higher. And so, the new set of articles we're generating for January, our goal is still 30\. the those articles are far far better than um what they have been. Let me just quickly share one on screen so you can see what that actually looks like. Um published in December. Great. So this is what those guys look like. So it's this is now fully AI generated headline content. Oh, come on, buddy. Um, and at a glance for what we're about to look at, uh, information, uh, context for why we're looking at more, uh, a set of jeans that are all like shoppable, ready to go, another set of this.  
   
 

### 00:19:16 {#00:19:16}

   
**Haje Jan Kamps:** And the whole point of this is trying to get us to rank for SEO for high-waisted jeans. Now, these articles are SEO to the eyeballs.  
**Stefania Allen:** Mhm.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** And the fact that it costs us almost nothing to generate. And the and the um idea here is that highwaisted genes is valuable enough that it's worth us putting out an article about it, even if the editorial team itself wouldn't necessarily be psyched about doing anything about it. Um and so really the hope there is that these articles can be generated at high enough scale that we put them out and they  
**Stefania Allen:** Yeah.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** actually start contributing towards revenue generation for content. Similarly the um the platform piece of it is uh contributed contributed output. So that is uh closets and guest articles and that's the the stuff you've been helping with identifying who would be good candidates for closets uh and pushing that through. Um, sorry that was a whole lot of words. I'm not entirely sure if I actually vaguely answered your question.  
   
 

### 00:20:15 {#00:20:15}

   
**Rafael Ortiz:** Well, let me let me see if I can give it a shot. My sense is that the strategy actually hasn't changed,  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** Yeah.  
**Rafael Ortiz:** but how we're getting there is changing. So I would articulate the strategy that we set in December as social first uh not subservient not subservient what's the right word not to drive traffic to website but social first really strong right one two super efficient testing AI assisted content three building trust through this platform play more contributors more experts I don't think that has changed what has changed is we've said, "We're not going to wait for the edit team to come around and embrace this." They're not. So, leave them where they want to be, which is doing the best editorial content they can do, and we're going to go get these other things done, which is really the AI and the expert contributed content without them. So, Stephie, to your point, if if you're not getting calls from any of the edit people, let's not ask them to do it anymore. I think for me that's one of the big changes in 26 is if you're not leading something that you should be leading in the role, the company will move beyond you and we'll find the people who can lead.  
   
 

### 00:21:30 {#00:21:30}

   
**Rafael Ortiz:** We've been asking editorial quite some time to do any of these things. They can't, won't, don't know how. I don't I don't really care anymore. Let them do what they want to do. And if that's the best editorial possible, let's see how that goes and we'll do these other things without them.  
**Stefania Allen:** Yeah. And I definitely wasn't coming on here to like complain or give like negative feedback about them. It was really more of like how can I support? I think where I agree that the strate I agree with the strategy. we're all in alignment. I think my question to both of you is is their strength really creating the best editorial content out there or is their desire actually to be front-facing talent? Um, if that's the case, actually put them there versus even creating it and just have more AI generated content because what you just showed me with the high-waisted jeans looks perfectly fine to me. And if your other stories are creating, you know, generating $3, like what is the actual point?  
   
 

### 00:22:29

   
**Stefania Allen:** um other than I guess having enough for Marissa to go and sell,  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** Mhm.  
**Stefania Allen:** but ultimately she can actually generate and create that own content for herself if she really needs it to sell against. So I think my question in bringing it up is more of like what are they working on because the strategy was them as front-facing talent using them to actually network to out you know to other talent. I would like to see them doing that, you know, because I think that that's where we need them because the content that they're Am I  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** Yeah,  
**Stefania Allen:** making  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** you're making total sense.  
**Stefania Allen:** sense?  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** I think what what we s saw happening was that Danielle was trying to come up with this other strategy and then I think the strategy was sound, but then she tried to do the execution piece and she kind of fell apart,  
**Stefania Allen:** Yeah.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** which you know um I had probably two hypes of two high hopes of her as a uh leader to drive this kind of thing where really she is more suited to be an IC or maybe the kind of driver of or as an editor, she's perfectly fine.  
   
 

### 00:23:41 {#00:23:41}

   
**Haje Jan Kamps:** She was she wasn't the person to drive a whole new strategy. And so she tried, she burned out on it, she left. And we're kind of left with, okay, now what the hell do we do? And so where where I in my mind kind of parked this was like, okay,  
**Stefania Allen:** Right.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** like editorial can't go dormant because I do think that to the point about trust, I think a lot of the trust that we get is from high quality editorial content on the site, right?  
**Stefania Allen:** Green.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** And so as long as that continues to take over um that is going to be a crucial component of that trust thing in my um estimation. If you guys disagree with that, let me know and we can do something different. But I think that's going to continue to be pretty important. Um and I do agree that Marissa can generate a lot of her own content, but at some point she's also selling on page views, right? And so the branded content typically performs a lot worse than the other stuff.  
   
 

### 00:24:31 {#00:24:31}

   
**Stefania Allen:** Okay.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** And so we do need the core content to continue to deliver page views. So she can say to her, oh say to an advertiser like, "Oh yeah, we'll write this piece of content for you and we get x million views to the site.  
**Rafael Ortiz:** And I I think we can start to say that the edit content even though it's shrunk right in terms of the number of people working on it, it is performing better because it is social first. So if we look at uh the big wins for edit produced content which is what Harry Jordan uh Danielle a freelancer or two if you look at this the social lift it's performed a lot better right and it's really the you know Harry's quick thinking on the whole row piece uh did super well Carolyn bet and her outfits did super super well like really really blew up on social and that  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** Yeah.  
**Rafael Ortiz:** probably is having some downstream effect for us on the website because the website edit content is growing. I'm not sure I know where it's growing, but I I see that it's growing for the first time in a year at  
   
 

### 00:25:42

   
**Haje Jan Kamps:** which is interesting because we are putting out less content.  
**Rafael Ortiz:** least  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** So I think what is happening is that some of the SEO stuff we have been doing is finally starting to work. Uh and there's going to be a little bit of dumb luck in there as well where like somehow like a couple of the articles that were performing really well just hit the zeitgeist. I mean they're not necessarily articles that are good for revenue generation like if you look at the best performing articles uh which slide is that um there's sorry let me quickly share this uh the best performing articles based on uh content uh so number of page views and sessions and stuff like who are the Gucci's well the people who land on that article are never going to buy right they're just curious curious about who the Gucci are. Best news sneakers for women. Yes. Fashion trends. Like it's unclear to me whether people are psyched about buying fashion trends or if they just want to stay in the loop.  
   
 

### 00:26:43 {#00:26:43}

   
**Haje Jan Kamps:** Um so there's like and the winter style landing page, right? Like these are all pages that we've created specifically around content more than revenue. And so what I'm trying to push the team towards is say look we have two goals. One is page views and one is revenue. And I want to figure out which article types drive which metric. So we can start titrating towards what we care about. Some months we say, "Okay, we want more revenue. Let's dial the dial that way." Some months we might say we want more traffic. I think the truth is for a lot of these it's often both, but there's going to be a bias either way. And that's what I'm trying to instill in the team is like, look, we're free to do what we want, but we have to hit our targets. And we won't do that unless we generate content that supports one or other of these goals. If you look at the best driving for revenue, latest fashion trends, best jeans for women, how to style a clutch bag, all those kind of stuff, right?  
   
 

### 00:27:42

   
**Haje Jan Kamps:** These are very clearly shopping driven stories. And so that's why they're generating um revenue for us. Like none of this is rocket surgery, but I was completely astonished by how little of this was being surfaced to the people actually doing the writing. And so this is why I'm really tasking uh with this page, which is look what worked and what needs improvement and really hammer down on like hey if we want to hit our KPIs, this is stuff stuff that works. We want more of that. we're timing this meeting with immediately before we commission the next month's content. And so really, it's front of mind when we're thinking about driving this stuff.  
**Stefania Allen:** Mhm.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** And I'm just like a little baffled we weren't doing this already. And I'm a little embarrassed that I didn't catch it earlier, but I think this is a meaningful um correction, course correction on how we think about what type of content we want to uh commission for edit specifically.  
**Stefania Allen:** Yeah, I think you picked up on a point that Danielle in a former meeting said, you know, uh, collages or something work, but we don't want to have all collages on our feed.  
   
 

### 00:28:52 {#00:28:52}

   
**Stefania Allen:** And I don't know if you remember, I was like, well, if that's what works, actually, we can do all collages on our feed. Like, it actually doesn't matter.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** right?  
**Stefania Allen:** and the amount of people that are going to our like homepage, they're still going to love it. Even if it's all collages, they're not going to be bad. So, I think you should definitely just do what works and don't I mean, obviously test and learn other stuff, but if it's all the outfits, if it's all collages, whatever it is, I think you should continue to do those.  
**Rafael Ortiz:** Exactly. It's let's be data driven. Let's be intellectually honest about what works and what doesn't. And I think we didn't have that in Danielle and anyone else, right? There was always like this spin whether it was conscious or subconscious. Let's be data driven. Let's make sure it works for a larger audience, right? Data driven in that way. And let's be really honest about what works. That was yeah,  
   
 

### 00:29:39

   
**Haje Jan Kamps:** Right.  
**Rafael Ortiz:** we could do a lot more of this. I mean, we're just scratching the surface. Like the way we got into doing collages, you know, there wasn't any deep insight. It was just like,  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** Right.  
**Rafael Ortiz:** oh,  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** Let's give it a whirl.  
**Rafael Ortiz:** it works for them. What if we try it?  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** Right. Yeah. And to your point, Stephie,  
**Rafael Ortiz:** Right.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** about the the native or the social native content, I had a borderline argument with uh Jordan about that.  
**Stefania Allen:** Okay.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** She was like, "We're not doing any social native content." I was like, "What are you talking about?" And I sent her a list of all the other um Instagram accounts that are doing really, really well with Instagram native social native content. And the level to which she wasn't dialed into that was a little scary.  
**Stefania Allen:** All  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** Uh and that made sense, right? Because until recently Danielle was in charge of that.  
   
 

### 00:30:30 {#00:30:30}

   
**Haje Jan Kamps:** But I think the truth is we have nobody on the team who really knows how to do social well or who has any  
**Stefania Allen:** right.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** sort of vision for what that looks like.  
**Rafael Ortiz:** Totally.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** Um Devon ain't it. Um but he's a as far as I can tell like his his remit was  
**Rafael Ortiz:** Yeah.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** to keep the lights on and the lights are on. So that ticks that box. And further to the conversation that like I open this call with we get to be more ambitious than the lights are still on. Like I think Devon has been around for uh several months now and I'm like I if we're not moving the needle I would like to find somebody who can um and I think the way to do that is to hire this head of content who can have a real vision and who knows what good content looks like but also is social native is also like understands all of this and then can take charge of figuring out who what are the resources  
   
 

### 00:31:19

   
**Stefania Allen:** It's  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** we need for this. Like Marissa's team, the stuff they've been doing on Tik Tok, I don't love the way how it came about, but they're really getting results. And I'm like, okay, I want that level of hunger on my team. Like, what's wrong with you? Like, I want people to go out and try stuff and be hungry. Um, anyway, I got a little head up about that.  
**Rafael Ortiz:** Yeah. Well,  
**Stefania Allen:** Yeah.  
**Rafael Ortiz:** there.  
**Stefania Allen:** And then go  
**Rafael Ortiz:** Go ahead. I mean, they're out there. We'll find them. So,  
**Stefania Allen:** ahead.  
**Rafael Ortiz:** you the question is where where do we go today?  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** Yeah.  
**Rafael Ortiz:** Uh, and the basics. Let's let our editorial be datadriven. It looks like you and are finally getting the team to do that, right? Let's be data driven. Trim what doesn't work. Do what does. Great.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** Yeah,  
   
 

### 00:32:12 {#00:32:12}

   
**Rafael Ortiz:** uh uh do more social first because we are getting some hits. However it is that we're getting it, let's keep let's let's take those as insights and be data driven about that,  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** right.  
**Rafael Ortiz:** right? Because there is some stuff working on social um and let's not be above copying  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** Yeah,  
**Rafael Ortiz:** concepts that are working for other handles that we believe speak to our  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** right.  
**Rafael Ortiz:** DNA, our audience and can be done in an elevated luxury way.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** Yep.  
**Rafael Ortiz:** and collages are a perfect example of that. Um we can keep doing that till till it doesn't work. So I think it means that our reduced editorial team keeps shrinking and  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** Yep.  
**Rafael Ortiz:** resides in a smaller and smaller box which um and again if if they want  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** Yeah.  
**Rafael Ortiz:** to help uh acquire contributors or other experts great we love it but let's do it with or without them.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** Yeah, I think the the the the winter of miscontent I'm hearing from uh Jordan in particular is like, okay, where's my career going if this is not being invested in?  
   
 

### 00:33:16

   
**Haje Jan Kamps:** And I'm also like, look, make it work.  
**Stefania Allen:** And I I think that that's okay.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** Like,  
**Stefania Allen:** I mean, I really feel like in Danielle advocated for herself in the end. She made a decision for herself that the direction wasn't where it was going.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** yeah.  
**Stefania Allen:** And I commend her for it and she made she did us a favor. Jordan should think about that. And honestly, hi, just my advice is to kind of that's not on you right now. Like I don't think you're mentoring up right now in terms of that's the role that you're in. It's like right now we're she's keeping the lights on and she can decide if this is the right fit or not. But get the most out of what we want that team for. And I think a little bit less with Harry than Jordan.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** Yeah.  
**Stefania Allen:** She's very vocal. But I mean, she doesn't even ping me anymore because I think it's the same conversation every time where it's like, Steph, but do you know about our CMS?  
   
 

### 00:34:04

   
**Stefania Allen:** And I was like, I don't care. I I don't and I don't actually care.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** Right.  
**Stefania Allen:** It's I don't know anything about it, you know?  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** Right. Yeah.  
**Stefania Allen:** And she  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** And I mean this is where like I understand the frustrations around the CMS,  
**Stefania Allen:** Yeah.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** but we also have a a larger content operations team than in any other organization I've been in. And if they can't do what we need them to do, we need to change that. I had conversation with Harini several times now and she's like, "No, I got this." Like great. Then I'm going to trust you that you got this. But then the rest of the team just needs to get on board. um as we're starting to throw more and more SEO um AI SEO content at them uh we will see whether or not the wheels come off but so far they've seem to have stepped up to the challenge. So I'm like I don't know where this narrative keeps coming from and I keep telling people was like look tell me about the bottlenecks and I'll go fix them.  
   
 

### 00:34:50

   
**Haje Jan Kamps:** I've spent and so this was my like this was my change of gears at the beginning of the year. I was like, I feel like I've been grinding my wheels in this content or trying to make it work when really my core job as we had a conversation about Rafy was like, how do I make this actually efficient and how do I make this work? This is why you're seeing these prototypes. This is why we have a whole bunch of additional tools for content generation. This is why the AI articles are finally working. I just went, you know what, to to quote Cartman, screw you guys. I'm going home. I like this is this is not working. So, I'm not going to keep pushing it. It's It's just not  
**Rafael Ortiz:** Yeah.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** productive.  
**Rafael Ortiz:** And you can go get any resource you want to put this into effect. The reality is engagement is going up on social.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** Yep.  
   
 

### 00:35:36 {#00:35:36}

   
**Rafael Ortiz:** Traffic is going up. I'm not exactly sure where where that is happening, but it's definitely happening. Let's keep doing  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** Yep.  
**Rafael Ortiz:** it.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** Yeah. No. And I think I mean that feels like kind of that was kind of my um plight with this meeting to you guys is like look I'm going to focus on the stuff that I think is going to work and I want to keep the lights on with core editorial because we I think we do need it. I think the halo effect of it is important and all the all the bits and pieces we've already talked about but I also think we don't have to invest heavily in it. Um, as we had a conversation about like the money that got freed up with Danielle leaving, we don't have to and we're not going to redeploy that into the freelance budget. Like we can just save that money and when we find some sort of a like if we find  
**Rafael Ortiz:** Yeah.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** ways of doing newsletter of one at scale and it costs 30 cents per newsletter, cool.  
   
 

### 00:36:33 {#00:36:33}

   
**Haje Jan Kamps:** Now we have a whole pool of money that I can spend towards that. I am much more eager and keen to do that than I am to  
**Rafael Ortiz:** Mhm.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** um grind my wheels against this other  
**Rafael Ortiz:** Yeah.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** piece.  
**Rafael Ortiz:** Don't Don't try to persuade the  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** Right.  
**Rafael Ortiz:** unpersuadable.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** I'm an optimist Rafie, but  
**Stefania Allen:** I think it's about just more create like original content based off of the themes  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** also  
**Stefania Allen:** that you know that work right so you said editor-led stylist themes or whatever and it's trying to figure out how we can deploy that budget and we've been trying to figure this out for I don't know, literally the last eight years. Um,  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** Yeah,  
**Stefania Allen:** and I think that that would still be the goal while we keep the lights on and innovate. It's like, you know, I don't know how much you guys have been looking and thinking about live shopping.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** great.  
**Stefania Allen:** Um, but live shopping is this concept that um, oh my god, what's the guy's name?  
   
 

### 00:37:30

   
**Stefania Allen:** Gary. Um, he does these podcasts and he's talking about like the next thing. Anyway, you guys know who he is and I'm going to send you the podcast.  
**Rafael Ortiz:** Oh,  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** Yeah,  
**Rafael Ortiz:** Gary Vaynerchuk.  
**Stefania Allen:** No.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** I mean he did jab jab punch and a bunch of like news hacky.  
**Stefania Allen:** Um,  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** He was an early social media influencer on how to But what I'm the reason I pulled this up is that this can be AI generated. This can be AI generated.  
**Stefania Allen:** right.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** This already is AI generated. This less so. But so for these three article types, like right now the we only have one template that is working, but these three basically are that template.  
**Stefania Allen:** You're  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** And so we can start doing a lot more of the stuff that we know is working with  
**Stefania Allen:** right.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** AI support.  
**Stefania Allen:** But what about social? Is that not even a conversation for you?  
   
 

### 00:38:25 {#00:38:25}

   
**Stefania Allen:** And that's more for Devon and Brian? Because this is where I get blurred because I'm like I'm,  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** Social is Yeah.  
**Stefania Allen:** you know, it's like all content to me. Um,  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** Right.  
**Stefania Allen:** so that's where I'm like I keep thinking about live shopping.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** I think that's  
**Stefania Allen:** It's Gary Vee. Um,  
**Rafael Ortiz:** Yeah. Gary  
**Stefania Allen:** yeah, Gary Vee. Um,  
**Rafael Ortiz:** Vaynerch.  
**Stefania Allen:** and he keeps being like it it's so hard to do things.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** Yeah.  
**Stefania Allen:** And he keeps talking about the live shopping that's coming out of um, China and it's like that's a direction that somebody could do. Nobody's doing it in a luxury way here because it's QVC. It is essentially what some people are doing on Instagram and Tik Tok.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** Right.  
**Stefania Allen:** There's a version of it and I keep being like I it's like we could crack it. It's just not that hard. I don't know how to do it.  
   
 

### 00:39:07 {#00:39:07}

   
**Stefania Allen:** I don't know how to do it. You know what I mean? And it's like do we want to invest time in that? Is that like a quick test that we do and we can kind of see like walking through and we find an editor or stylist or me and we walk through a store and we do live shopping. What if it's at the web right here and I just do it to test it? I don't know. It's a concept that I keep thinking about. So, I'm like, okay, if you wanted to take the budget of Danielle, even a fraction of it, and deploy it, but would that be talking to you and Devon? I'm sorry, Brian and Devon, or is that your team? Like, I that's what I don't  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** I have an answer.  
**Stefania Allen:** know.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** Um I think I think the challenge is that when we decided to keep the lights on um we decided  
**Rafael Ortiz:** Go for it.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** that social belongs to Brian because it's essentially a marketing function, right?  
   
 

### 00:39:50

   
**Haje Jan Kamps:** That makes sense except that is not social that is not social native. When it's a marketing function, it's a way to drive um um traffic to our shop or to our pages. If we think about it as a social native function, it kind of becomes a different beast. And the truth is right now in our pre in our um previous attempt at this Danielle, Jordan, Harry, everybody was psyched to do a lot more or psyched they were willing to do a lot more uh social native  
**Stefania Allen:** Right.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** content. But really it was Danielle who's like keeping her thumb on the scales for driving that forward. Without her pressure, a lot of that is quieting down.  
**Stefania Allen:** That's exactly what I'm referring to.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** I don't Yeah. And I don't think Devon is the right person to drive that.  
**Stefania Allen:** Yeah.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** And I this is where my weakness comes in to be honest. I know it's good or bad when I see it, but I'm not I'm not able to create a vision around what works and what doesn't work.  
   
 

### 00:40:42 {#00:40:42}

   
**Haje Jan Kamps:** And so I think this is where we need somebody who can actually own it and run with  
**Stefania Allen:** So, I think that this could be a good discussion for you,  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** it.  
**Stefania Allen:** me, and Brian because I've reached out to him, too. I think you've seen me being like, "How can I help Devon?" Like, tell me. And again,  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** Yeah.  
**Stefania Allen:** it's okay if we're also just keeping the lights on over there and don't want to do this. But to your point, I think that there's still more that we can do even with our current team.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** Mhm.  
**Stefania Allen:** Um,  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** Yes.  
**Stefania Allen:** yeah.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** If Devon is good.  
**Stefania Allen:** I don't think that this is for Brian to drive forward either. Like I because when I he's like Yeah.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** I don't think this is this is firmly a content like social is content.  
**Stefania Allen:** He's like socialist.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** I Yeah. And there is an asterisk there where some social is growth marketing.  
   
 

### 00:41:22 {#00:41:22}

   
**Stefania Allen:** Yeah.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** But I think it makes sense for the core function of social to live under content. The problem is our current content team is old school paper and pencil journalists and they're not like the conversations I've had with them about oh what what do you want to try has just been really unambitious. It's it's really telling that Rafie is the one who comes up with most of the new concepts for social in this company when it's definitely not his strength. It's definitely isn't mine, but somehow that's where it's flowing from. And now it's flowing from Marissa, right? That's not the way it should be. We need somebody in that seat who can go, I am so excited about trying all these different stuff. Let's throw something at the wall. Let's see what sticks. Let's try 10 things. Let's kill seven. Let's take those three that kind of worked and expand on that. Like I'm not seeing that drive from anybody in  
   
 

### 00:42:21

   
**Rafael Ortiz:** Uh yeah.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** social.  
**Rafael Ortiz:** So given that given that we don't have our head of content, I would advocate that we just keep doing what we've recently been doing. Let's be data driven.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** Yeah.  
**Rafael Ortiz:** Let's copy what works elsewhere. Super high engagement as long as we know it's right for our audience and we do it. That's all we're doing.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** Yep.  
**Rafael Ortiz:** Collages. We're not done yet. Let's do more collages. Uh expert clauses or variations with experts, contributors, we're not done yet. We're just scratching the surface. Street style. We know it works for OOTD and a zillion other handles. We're not done yet.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** Yeah.  
**Rafael Ortiz:** I would advocate that we rather than like try to complicate it too much given that we're pretty limited with the talent we have in the company is let's do more of what works as long as we believe in it that it has a the right  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** Yep.  
**Rafael Ortiz:** strategic path.  
   
 

### 00:43:13 {#00:43:13}

   
**Rafael Ortiz:** And if Harry wants to jump in and he's inspired with like a piece on the road, great. Jump in. You can do that. We won't ban you,  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** Yep.  
**Rafael Ortiz:** but expecting our edit team to lead what they've never been able to lead that we're done. We've turned that  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** Yep. Yeah. And I think there is a world where somebody sits and ideates and comes up with cool grand big ideas.  
**Rafael Ortiz:** page.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** I mean like the more I'm thinking about it, the more that is Sarah's job description, right? The thing she was meant to be doing, but then now without Sarah and without her social team,  
**Rafael Ortiz:** Yeah.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** we're actually growing faster than we did with them, which is like, okay, conceptually something was pretty wrong there. But I think as a as a like having somebody who's hungry and willing to drive an experiment I think is is the way that we change that. But the order of operations will probably be find a good head of content who is excited to run a bunch of uh experiments and try stuff out.  
   
 

### 00:44:09

   
**Haje Jan Kamps:** They can bring in whatever resources they think are needed for that and then start driving that forward again. Meanwhile, we keep the lights on as far as we can. We see some improvements. We see some increas like the numbers are going up. Like I don't really fully understand why that team is completely underresourced, but they're doing it. It's like great,  
**Rafael Ortiz:** It's going way better. Yeah. So, I I'd say,  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** let's  
**Rafael Ortiz:** you know, this isn't the most aspirational statement, but since it's the three of us, do what works. copy formulas that work elsewhere that drive super high engagement.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** right,  
**Rafael Ortiz:** All the smart people on social are doing this anyway, right? They're they're tracking everyone's handles. They're seeing what works. They're copying. I mean, social is a very fastmoving game. That's one thing I can understand. I don't know how to create it.  
**Stefania Allen:** Oops.  
**Rafael Ortiz:** So, we can play that game,  
   
 

### 00:44:50

   
**Haje Jan Kamps:** Right.  
**Rafael Ortiz:** too. Be data driven. Copy s\*\*\* that works. Do it here in luxury because that still puts us a little bit ahead of most in luxury.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** Right.  
**Rafael Ortiz:** Luxury isn't the most innovative category.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** Right. Agreed.  
**Rafael Ortiz:** So we don't want to talk about that in a company that's not aspirational but it will work. Uh it already is working to some degree and eventually we'll find the person who will take that and like really accelerate  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** Yep. Yeah. And it's kind of yummy to have a big like pin in the wall that says,  
**Rafael Ortiz:** it.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** "Hey, there's a huge opportunity here. We just don't know how to execute on it yet. We just need the kind of the set set the set the set the pieces on the board so we can and I think social is one of them. AIO has been that for months and now we're start finally starting to see that.  
   
 

### 00:45:34 {#00:45:34}

   
**Haje Jan Kamps:** Um I have some big thoughts and working with Zeba on when it comes to the closets initiative. Again, I think we're being really under ambitious. Like, I think we could do far better with what we have, not in terms of who we select, but how we present it and how integrated it looks and all that kind of stuff.  
**Rafael Ortiz:** Exactly. So along those lines,  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** And  
**Rafael Ortiz:** since Stephiey's on the line with us, anything that is platform like experts, contributors, that's that's this team over here. Don't don't drag edit into it.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** right.  
**Rafael Ortiz:** Let's keep moving forward with that. I talked a lot to Puke about this on yesterday uh yesterday.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** Yeah.  
**Stefania Allen:** Yes.  
**Rafael Ortiz:** So, we're getting there, but I agree. We're not being that ambitious. Just don't drag editorial into it. We're going to do this without  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** Yeah.  
**Stefania Allen:** So, while we're on that topic,  
**Rafael Ortiz:** them.  
**Stefania Allen:** did Zaba come back to either of you in terms of negotiating like did we land on a percentage that we wanted to go out to talent with?  
   
 

### 00:46:25

   
**Stefania Allen:** Because I've been looping in the talent and then we've been going and I, you know,  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** Right.  
**Stefania Allen:** ZA at first I was like, you know, well, maybe we should negotiate and do that and I was like, wait, I'm going to give Katherine Cop an actual heart attack. Like, how are we going to do this in terms of the finances? So I said, "Go back to Hay and Rafie.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** Right.  
**Stefania Allen:** One or the other. I'm not sure who. Decide on what that number needs to look like and then come to me and I'll close the  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** Yeah. My thought on that is that the number needs to be two things.  
**Stefania Allen:** deal.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** It's an advance and it's a uh percentage. The advance means that they're incentivized to actually do it. So, I don't know what the number is. Maybe it's 500 bucks or maybe it's a grand, I don't know. But we say, "Look, we give you an advance on your um on your commission and we that means that we  
   
 

### 00:47:03 {#00:47:03}

   
**Stefania Allen:** Awesome.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** um incentivize them enough to get involved. We know what how much money we owe them. And if at some point they burn through their advance and we start having to pay them tens of thousands of dollars of commissions, awesome. That's a great problem to have.  
**Stefania Allen:** Awesome. Yeah. Great.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** I don't know what the percentage should be,  
**Stefania Allen:** That's that's where I think we're stuck and I don't want it to slow anything down because we've got four big people that are  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** right?  
**Stefania Allen:** willing to do stuff that are micros, right? So, but they're micro macros, meaning like they're the right person in the right sector. Um,  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** Right.  
**Stefania Allen:** so we've gotten the Go ahead.  
**Rafael Ortiz:** 25%.  
**Stefania Allen:** That's what I I mean, that's what you had said. We're g I don't care. We're going to lose money,  
**Rafael Ortiz:** Do it.  
**Stefania Allen:** but I don't care.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** All  
**Rafael Ortiz:** It's not really the point right now.  
   
 

### 00:47:51

   
**Rafael Ortiz:** We're not We're not going to do this backwards where we're like,  
**Stefania Allen:** I get  
**Rafael Ortiz:** "Oh, what can we afford? Oh, 50 cents. We'll pay you 50 cents. f\*\*\* that." It's going to be 25%.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** right.  
**Rafael Ortiz:** We're going to eliminate that as an object as an objection. Yes. Would we want to scale this to 10 millions of dollars and pay 25%?  
**Stefania Allen:** Great.  
**Rafael Ortiz:** Of course not.  
**Stefania Allen:** Great.  
**Rafael Ortiz:** But I'll we'll deal with that when we  
**Stefania Allen:** Thank you. You just honestly you saved all of us time.  
**Rafael Ortiz:** get  
**Stefania Allen:** It's 25%. I think ha to your point an advance would be great but given it's such a competitive commission compared to where shop my is at 12% because I I poked and prodded with some of the people that we've been talking to who are at 10 to 12% we don't need to give them advance it's 25%.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** Is it 25% on what we get or 25% on net?  
   
 

### 00:48:33

   
**Stefania Allen:** on net is my understanding.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** Great. That's a great commission.  
**Stefania Allen:** It's a f\*\*\*\*\*\*  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** Yeah,  
**Stefania Allen:** insane commission which is why you're going  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** that's more than we make, but that's great. That's a  
**Rafael Ortiz:** Yeah,  
**Stefania Allen:** to  
**Rafael Ortiz:** we we we know we have a rough product. We don't have a an easy platform for them to use. So, we're going to compensate for that. But what we will do is we need to focus on that top of the influencer pyramid. micro influencers that really are true luxury and we need to suck all those ones into our platform. So until the strategy is clear and the technology is good,  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** Yeah,  
**Rafael Ortiz:** we're going to pay them handsome  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** great.  
**Stefania Allen:** Great.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** Awesome. Thank  
**Stefania Allen:** Okay.  
**Rafael Ortiz:** commissions.  
**Stefania Allen:** So, that's easy enough.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** you.  
**Stefania Allen:** I think I have what I need from this meeting, which was where are we?  
   
 

### 00:49:17

   
**Stefania Allen:** Because Danielle left and I'm was lost and confused. If I would repeat what you guys said back,  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** Yeah.  
**Stefania Allen:** let the edit team continue doing what they're doing. Hi, come to me if you want to innovate on anything just as like from a gut check perspective in terms of what you might want to play with. I'll go to Devon to talk about more social first ideas. I'm happy to come to you too and then I'm going to I want somebody to think about this live shopping because I'm obsessed with it.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** I mean, it's it's shown to work in lots of different things. I mean, the Tik Tok shop runs nuts on this stuff.  
**Stefania Allen:** That's I mean Gary Vee says the one concept that could work in 2026\.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** Um,  
**Stefania Allen:** Do we trust him? I don't know. But if you have the right person doing it,  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** look,  
**Stefania Allen:** he could very well be right.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** I wouldn't bet against Gary Vee in general.  
   
 

### 00:50:07

   
**Stefania Allen:** You what?  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** I would not bet against him in general.  
**Stefania Allen:** I wouldn't bet against him either. So if like I don't know if I could be funny and cute on live shopping in a store, maybe we could sell a couple things and try. I don't know.  
**Rafael Ortiz:** I would love to see but but really the point is we should be free to experiment and try this stuff. You you need a partner uh to do it. And again, if we can find a handle that is crushing it on TikTok with engagement and purchases, let's take that insight, copy it, do it in the editorialist way, and give it a shot. It It's worked thus  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** Yep.  
**Rafael Ortiz:** far.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** Yep. Love it.  
**Stefania Allen:** Yeah.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** All right.  
**Rafael Ortiz:** I think that would be really fun.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** Thank  
**Rafael Ortiz:** And if there's one place I know you're comfortable, Stephie,  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** you.  
**Rafael Ortiz:** it's walking around in a luxury goods  
**Stefania Allen:** Yeah.  
   
 

### 00:50:52 {#00:50:52}

   
**Stefania Allen:** That's really where I only should be.  
**Rafael Ortiz:** store.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** I'm I'm I'm with you.  
**Stefania Allen:** Like I said, why am I sitting behind a desk?  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** Um um thank you both  
**Stefania Allen:** Who needs me here?  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** very much. This was super super helpful. Is this a useful use of this meeting uh going forward, this type of conversation? I know it was originally meant for something else,  
**Stefania Allen:** I will say very I hate meetings.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** but  
**Stefania Allen:** This was very useful for me because I don't know what's going on. You guys meet more often. So Rafie, it's up to you. I I I thought it was very helpful for me.  
**Rafael Ortiz:** I mean, we're in the middle of transformation, so we need to meet. Um,  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** Yep.  
**Rafael Ortiz:** we're in the middle of transformation.  
**Stefania Allen:** I would just say that we should include Brian in it because social is such a big part of  
**Rafael Ortiz:** Let's transform. Yeah, I was going to suggest that,  
   
 

### 00:51:35

   
**Stefania Allen:** this.  
**Rafael Ortiz:** too, but um I didn't really look at this until just before the meeting. So, um but yes.  
**Stefania Allen:** It's just I would just incorporate him into it and then if he you know like then he can relay in the short term while he's still managing Devon things that we want to test or you know I don't know but I I think having him included is  
**Rafael Ortiz:** I I I agree because he's also interviewing a variety of social agencies from small to  
**Stefania Allen:** helpful.  
**Rafael Ortiz:** big. Um so he is looking out there uh at bringing resources if we don't end up sticking with Devon.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** Yep.  
**Stefania Allen:** Okay.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** I'll uh add him to this meeting.  
**Stefania Allen:** And is Danielle still like did she go dark? Is she not dark?  
**Rafael Ortiz:** Cool.  
**Stefania Allen:** Is she still  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** She is now hourly and so I have given the team a really tight brief. I'm like, "Look,  
**Stefania Allen:** right?  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** we need her for some article writing.  
   
 

### 00:52:29

   
**Haje Jan Kamps:** We need her for some whatever." Yes, great. But it's not going to be, "Oh, Danielle, can you quickly look at this? Oh, Danielle, can you like I've I've I've really tightened her scope as much as possible." Um, and she's limited on the number of hours. And I've been like, "Hey, Danielle, you need to say no to stuff." And if Branded comes to you, they need to open a separate contract. I'm not doing more than so and so many hours per month with you. Like, end of story. And so, that's that's probably why I haven't heard from her because I don't want her to uh run the clock while she's nering to people around the business.  
**Stefania Allen:** Fair enough. But we do have this issue of it's not an issue. People go to different people like Marissa and Lindsay came to me being like Devon and Brian came to us to talk about talent. So we want to make sure that they're talking to I'm like how funny.  
   
 

### 00:53:15 {#00:53:15}

   
**Stefania Allen:** I've been pinging them about it but they don't want to talk like talk to me. I'm like talk to me. It's like they're avoiding  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** Right. I find that hard to believe  
**Stefania Allen:** me.  
**Rafael Ortiz:** I think they I don't think they they actually knew to go to you,  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** Stephie.  
**Stefania Allen:** I know.  
**Rafael Ortiz:** Steph.  
**Stefania Allen:** Well, bless their heart. They'll know now.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** Nice.  
**Stefania Allen:** Um,  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** All  
**Stefania Allen:** all right, cool.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** right.  
**Stefania Allen:** Um, I mean that's it from my perspective. Hi, if the styling team can be of help, please let me know.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** Yeah. So,  
**Stefania Allen:** I mean I Oh,  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** I'm gonna lean on Gabby pretty heavily for the next stretch.  
**Stefania Allen:** awesome.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** Yeah.  
**Stefania Allen:** Great.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** So she turned she turned up really so we ran a short kind of test with her last year at the tail end of last year basically talking about okay how can we do human in the middle for this then  
   
 

### 00:54:04

   
**Stefania Allen:** Yeah.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** we went back to building technology and I've been kind of pretending to be a stylist uh which whatever but  
**Stefania Allen:** Okay.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** now we're back to like okay now we put the human in the middle for a human who actually knows what they're talking about  
**Stefania Allen:** Pilot. Great.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** so I'm going to be leaning on her quite heavily for the next batch of about 60 articles uh  
**Stefania Allen:** Oh my god. I didn't realize that. I'm seeing her on Thursday at this big client's home here in Miami.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** Yeah.  
**Stefania Allen:** So, um I'll I'll mention to her to come to me if she has any  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** Yeah. I mean,  
**Stefania Allen:** questions.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** I've she's been a little flaky with how quickly she gets back to me, but I'm don't don't worry about that. I'm managing that part.  
**Stefania Allen:** That's what you have to know in terms of,  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** U what I want to figure out is  
**Stefania Allen:** you know, she's a working mom.  
   
 

### 00:54:49

   
**Stefania Allen:** Uh and she's an hourly employee.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** Right.  
**Stefania Allen:** So, right, like she's a week.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** Yeah.  
**Stefania Allen:** I I called her today because I was like, I'm seeing you on Thursday. Like, are we good? And she's like, I'm at Disney World. I was like, "Great. That's why I don't hire you full-time." But she is got she's quality  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** Right. Totally.  
**Stefania Allen:** work. Um, and she'll deliver. It just might not be exactly the day you want  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** That's totally fine.  
**Stefania Allen:** it.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** I mean, I I just got to we got to find uh Anyway, this is all operations. I've got this. But yeah,  
**Stefania Allen:** But if you need more people for that,  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** I'm working with her.  
**Stefania Allen:** Mariela's good for that, too. Like, if if it's just needing styling and like pick, I've got a team of hourly employees that can do that.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** I love that. And the tooling is now such that it's very easy like there's good documentation.  
   
 

### 00:55:31 {#00:55:31}

   
**Haje Jan Kamps:** It's very easy for them to do that part of the job. It shows exactly what I'm expecting from them. It shows what we're So the tooling part of it has made it much much much  
**Stefania Allen:** Wait, sorry,  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** easier.  
**Stefania Allen:** full circle. But like the high-waisted story moment. Was that Gabby?  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** That was me.  
**Stefania Allen:** Well, that was great, but it shouldn't be you.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** I totally agree.  
**Stefania Allen:** Don't even Wait.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** It was just when we were closing the  
**Stefania Allen:** Hi. Don't even have your edit team touch those stories.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** loop.  
**Stefania Allen:** Have my stylist do that. have Marila and Gabby do that. I will like the stories more.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** Yep.  
**Stefania Allen:** I promise you and it will be cheaper.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** Yes. Yep. Yep.  
**Stefania Allen:** Don't have them touch it.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** Totally.  
**Stefania Allen:** Those women would be happy for more hours, more work.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** Yep.  
   
 

### 00:56:10 {#00:56:10}

   
**Stefania Allen:** Um, and we will like the outcomes a lot better. I assure you there's no one that knows product like my  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** Great.  
**Stefania Allen:** team.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** I love that. And and to be clear, I did it like me personally,  
**Stefania Allen:** Well, I know I liked what you did,  
**Rafael Ortiz:** Love  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** which means,  
**Stefania Allen:** but like you shouldn't have to do that.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** right, so the next batch, we have a bunch of the uh product selects and uh content that uh Gabby wrote for us. Uh so that's actually going to be fully her. And so the AI is currently noodling away on those things. But then the next set after that um I'm trying to set this up as far as possible to be fully scalable so we can in theory like we're trying to scale up to a hundred a month by  
**Rafael Ortiz:** What's  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** March. Um and at that point we need multiple people.  
**Rafael Ortiz:** this?  
**Stefania Allen:** you you have to have Mariana do this too because there's no way Gabby's going to get you that quantity.  
   
 

### 00:56:55 {#00:56:55}

   
**Haje Jan Kamps:** So  
**Stefania Allen:** But Mariela is doing less with styling currently because we shifted some things  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** great.  
**Stefania Allen:** around. So she has bandwidth and again she's a very similar thing to Gabby.  
**Haje Jan Kamps:** Awesome.  
**Stefania Allen:** Like she's a mom of four. Uber Luxury was also at Disney World with Gabby. But you're going to get the best content, just maybe not the exact day you need
